The High Command had just put down a coup attempt from the self-proclaimed Crown Prince Raschallion, and a crack down on any form of dissent against the new government was underway. These political and social outcasts, known as the Gray Order, sought to leave their neighbors in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge. The leaders of this outcast society were a married couple: Gregori Hastur, the Gray Warlock, and his wife Amoline, the Shadow Witch. Together they led an exodus of magicians and other intelligentsia from Noxus, resettling their followers beyond the Great Barrier to the northern reaches of the unforgiving Voodoo Lands. Though survival was a challenge at times, the Gray Order's colony managed to thrive in a land where so many others would have failed.\n\nYears after the exodus, Gregori and Amoline had a child: Annie. Early on, Annie's parents knew there was something special about their daughter. At the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorcelled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet. To this day she keeps her bear ''Tibbers'' by her side, often keeping him spellbound as a stuffed doll to be carried like a child's toy. The combination of Annie's lineage and the dark magic of her birthplace have given this little girl tremendous arcane power. It is this same girl who now finds herself as one of the most sought-after champions within the League of Legends - even by the city-state that would have exiled her parents had they not fled beforehand.\n\n''Annie may be one of the most powerful champions ever to have fought in a Field of Justice. I shudder to think of her capabilities when she becomes an adult.''\n-- High Councilor Kiersta Mandrake","DescriptionCN":"在联盟成立之前不久，诺克萨斯邪恶城邦里有人不同意诺克萨斯最高指挥部的所作所为。诺克萨斯最高指挥部刚镇压了自称王储的瑞斯卡里奥发动的政变。他们正准备镇压任何对新政府有异议的行动或组织。\n\n这群称作灰色秩序的政治与社会的放逐者，试图安静地离开他们的邻居，因为他们追求的是黑暗的秘术知识。这个组织的领导者是一对夫妻：神秘术士格雷戈里·哈斯塔和他的妻子暗影巫女阿莫琳。他们从瓦洛兰大陆带走了一批魔法师和其他知识分子。他们越过宏伟屏障，在禁忌的巫毒之地北部重新安家。虽然生存时常充满挑战，但他们却超越前人，成功地在这里生活下去。\n\nY几年之后，格雷戈里和阿莫琳生了个女儿，她的名字叫做安妮。很早的时候，安妮的父母就知道安妮有特别之处。两岁时，安妮神奇地用魔法驯服了来自树化石林的凶猛暗影熊，把它变成她的宠物。至今，她都把“泰迪”带在身边。安妮通常将它变成一个玩具熊，就像普通孩子的玩偶一样。身上流淌的血液和出色的黑暗魔法让安妮拥有惊人的秘术能量。联盟的人认为这个女孩是最受欢迎的英雄之一，连要驱逐她父母的城邦居民也不例外。\n\n“安妮或许是正义战场上最强大的英雄之一，我一想到她长大后的能力就不寒而栗。”\n—— 高级议员基思塔·曼德拉克。","AttackPoints":2,"HealthPoints":3,"Difficulty":4,"SpellsPoints":10,"Abilities":[{"Icon":"../data/annie_the_dark_child_a1.jpg","NameEN":"Disintegrate","NameCN":"碎裂之火","DescriptionEN":"Annie hurls a mana-infused fireball, dealing damage and refunding the mana cost if it destroys the target.","DescriptionCN":"安妮向目标释放巨大的火球造成伤害，若目标死于该法术则返还法力值。","EffectEN":"Deals 85/125/165/205/245 (+0.7) magic damage.
